## Current status

*In short: I'm no longer maintaining these configs. See the section above for a
download link to the final release.*

In 2009, I started writing a set of TF2 performance configs that would
eventually become probably the most widely used in TF2 today, both in public
and competitive play. Very quickly Arie stepped in and offered to provide web
hosting for the configs, and they quickly became the most requested thing on
the FakkelBrigade site. Many thanks go to him for his patience and support over
the years.<

I stopped playing competitive TF2 in early 2012 to focus on other things, and
slowly over time I became less and less in touch with the TF2 community, and
the technical details of TF2's implementation of Source. Valve frequently
releases updates which change the way that game internals work, and being so
out of touch with what was going on affected the quality of these configs.<

I should have offered them up earlier, as I have basically been unable to
continue maintaining them for over half a year now. My knowledge of the Source
engine is still high, but it is out of date, and worse so, I don't know where
it is out of date. I'm not planning to return to TF2, so it's not right that I
continue attempting to maintain the scripts without having the knowledge to do
so any more. Too many people use them for that to be worthy of consideration.

As such, I'm releasing them into the public domain. Feel free to do
absolutely anything you want with them. You do not need to credit me (in fact,
if you are making modifications, please do not associate me with them).
