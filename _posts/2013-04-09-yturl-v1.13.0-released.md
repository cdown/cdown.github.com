title: yturl v1.13.0 released
---

I released [yturl](https://github.com/cdown/yturl/) v1.13.0 today, you can see a
snapshot for this tag [here](https://github.com/cdown/yturl/tree/v1.13.0). The
major changes are...

- New `--quality` option (see below)
- Itags are now internally hardcoded again. I can't imagine why someone would
  want to change them, and it decreases usability in certain situations
- New itags: 36, 46

## New --quality option

There is a new `--quality` (shorthand `-q`) option that can determine the itag
to use without the user explicitly having to specify it. It accepts either
high, medium (the default), low, or an explicit itag.

## Specification of multiple itags

You can no longer specify multiple preferential itags. Since yturl
automatically works out the closest itag to the one you requested, I can't
really figure out a use case for this.

## AUR packages

I brought the [yturl](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yturl) AUR package
back from the dead. For a while I deprecated it in favour of
[yturl-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yturl-git), but now with a more
sensible infrastructure I don't think it's a problem to maintain both.

The yturl-git package now also has a different versioning scheme:
`%Y%m%d%H%M%S-commit`.

## Move to semantic versioning

We now use true semantic versioning to refer to yturl releases. We were very
close before (v1.12 -> v1.13.0).
