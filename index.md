I'm the 6th most trusted expert globally on Unix & Linux Stack Exchange, and a
regular on many Unix mailing lists. Correctness and simplicity (in that order)
are my main goals when developing any system.

In my free time, I design robust, concise applications across a wide spectrum
of languages. You can find my public code on [my GitHub][github]. I currently
work as a sysadmin/devops engineer for [Regent Markets Group][rmg] in
Cyberjaya, Malaysia. I'm also involved with [Initiatives of Change][iofc],
mostly maintaining and implementing systems for use in the [Caux conference
centre][caux] in Caux, Switzerland.

I'm always interested in hearing about ideas for new projects. If you have
something you'd like me to help out on, [get in touch][email].
