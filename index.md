I'm the 6th most trusted expert globally on Unix & Linux Stack Exchange, and a
regular on many Unix mailing lists. Correctness and simplicity (in that order)
are my main goals when developing any system.

I currently work as a sysadmin/devops engineer for [Regent Markets Group][rmg]
in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. I'm also involved with [Initiatives of Change][iofc],
mostly maintaining and implementing systems for use in the [Caux conference
centre][caux] in Caux, Switzerland.

In my free time I design robust applications with a focus on correctness and
ease of operation. You can find my public code on [my GitHub][github].
