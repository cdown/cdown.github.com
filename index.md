Hey there! I'm a SRE, software developer, and system administrator, currently
working as a [Production Engineer][]/SRE at [Facebook][]. I work as part of the
Web Foundation team, responsible for the overall performance and reliability of
Facebook's user-facing products. I concieve, design, and improve systems that
make Facebook more performant, scalable, and reliable.

Most of my active work is around operating system primitives, like
[cgroups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZ8_mRotT4),
[systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd),
[eBPF](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/ebpf), containerisation, and a bunch
of Facebook-internal technologies.
