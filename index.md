Hey there! I'm a software developer and system administrator, currently working
as a [Production Engineer][]/SRE at [Facebook][]. I work as part of the Web
Foundation team, responsible for the overall performance and reliability of
Facebook's user-facing products. I concieve, design, and improve systems that
make Facebook more performant, scalable, and reliable.
