title: "Deus Ex: The Missing Link, and how to do DLC wrong"
excerpt: "On the ups and downs of The Missing Link DLC for Deus Ex: Human Revolution."

I bought a [Lenovo Y500][y500] a few days ago, and so far everything has been
going great. I've been longing to get back into playing games since I stopped
playing competitive TF2 two or so years ago, and it's been a real treat to be
able to do it again.

I downloaded Steam, and the first thing that came up in my favourites at the
top of the browser was Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It was one of the last games
that I played, but it feels recent. Funny to think it was nearly two years ago
that I last played anything. It seemed a good enough place to start. Apparently
I had also bought the DLC, [The Missing Link][missinglink], which I hadn't
played in my previous playthrough, probably because I only bought it
afterwards, hoping to play it in my next playthrough that never came. Two years
later, I finally played it.

Anyone who knows me in person knows that when I discuss video games, I almost
inevitably bring up the original [Deus Ex][dx]. I picked a copy of it up in a
bargain bin around 2002-03, and I distinctly remember having to lower the
resolution and texture quality because my crappy card couldn't handle it at the
time. This was pretty much the game that defined video gaming for me. The
sinister atmosphere presented by the music, the lighting, the characters was
all coherent, and extremely immersing. The storyline was just the right mix of
the ludicrous and familiar to invoke a real feeling of involvement. To this
day, I still think Deus Ex is the best video game of all time.

I still enjoyed its sequel, Invisible War. I was young, and more interested in
atmosphere than gameplay, so I didn't notice the backsteps that had been taken
in terms of unified ammunition and the like. I still loved it, no matter what
the reviews said.

I paid a lot of attention when DX:HR was announced through the teaser clips that
Eidos put out. It was clear that they were pining for commercial success, and I
prayed they wouldn't screw it up. For the most part, they got it right, and DX:HR
is a good game, and well worth playing. Unfortunately, it's particularly messed
up by the boss battles, which destroy the atmosphere completely. I don't even
care that you have to kill people --- you did in DX1, too, after all --- just
that they are presented as deathmatching situations that take away any illusion
of choice from the player.

The Missing Link is a whole other beast, though. There are no boss battles, in
fact, in terms of gameplay they got almost everything right. What they got
wrong, however, is an entirely separate list.

Why on earth would you not integrate your DLC directly with your main game,
instead relying on the player to work out when they should start playing the
DLC? I already knew when to start playing the DLC, compared to the main
storyline, but how on Earth is a new player supposed to know that without
having to read plot spoilers?

The entire DLC takes place on a small map that you repeatedly navigate back and
forth. It's not a map as much as a linear system of checkpoints (I mean really,
there even basically *are* checkpoints in the form of biometric scanner gates).
That really sucks, that's never what Deus Ex was about. At least there are no
boss battles.

If you are going to ship a DLC for your game, then yes, link it with the
storyline. That much was right. Why on earth you would not integrate it with
your game, though (or at the very least, prompt the player to launch it when it
is time), is just totally baffling to me.

It's an enjoyable play, though, despite these points. I just wish Eidos would
stop fucking around.
