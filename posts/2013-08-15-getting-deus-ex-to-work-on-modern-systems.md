This is basically a terse rehash of [Marijn Kentie's article][dxms], which I
always find too verbose when I want to get down to playing Deus Ex again.

- [Download Deus Exe][dexe] and extract to the System directory
- [Download New Vision][newvision], which contains Marijn Kentie's DX10
  renderer
- [Download the DX10 renderer][dx10], since the one shipped with NV is likely
  old
- [Download the 1.112fm map patches][maps]
- [Download the fan patch][fanpatch]
