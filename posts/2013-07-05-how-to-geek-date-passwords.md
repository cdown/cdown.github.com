> This method uses SHA to hash the date, runs through base64, and then outputs
> the top 32 characters.

>     date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 32 ; echo
>
> And hereâ€™s the easiest way to make a password from the command line, which
> works in Linux, Windows with Cygwin, and probably Mac OS X \[...\]
>
>     date | md5sum
