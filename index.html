<p>I write simple, minimalist applications, mostly to fulfil my own needs. I try to adhere to Dieter Rams' <em><a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design">ten principles of good design</a></em> wherever possible.</p>

<p>You can find my project Git repositories on my <a href="{{ site.links.github }}">GitHub</a> profile, and there is also Travis CI build information for selected repositories on the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page. I package some of my projects for Arch Linux (although there are unofficial builds on other distributions, too) &mdash; you can find my AUR packages <a href="{{ site.links.aur }}">here</a>, and a set of Git repositories to manage their packaging <a href="https://github.com/cdown-aur/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to get in contact with me, the fastest and most reliable way is by e-mail. You can find my contact details present within the footer of every page on this site.</p>
