title: Resources to improve your Mandarin proficiency, or get started
---

When I started learning Mandarin last year, it's not something that I sincerely
expected to be able to be proficient in. I'm still a long way from proficiency,
but this year of learning has taught me some wonderful things, not only about
language, but also about the parity by which language can mirror our cultural
assumptions, and how powerful it can be in questioning the unspoken (and
myopic) notion of "common sense". Mandarin is simply an amazing language,
filled with amazing constructions and wonderful phrases.

This post is basically a list of resources that I have found valuable during my
time learning, in the hope that it will aid other learners that seek to study.

## Studying

Starting out requires some drive. The most important thing is to get a solid
understanding of basic Chinese grammar without boring yourself to death reading
grammar rules that you won't even use until later.

### Pimsleur

I was quite lucky to have [a good friend of mine][Carlos] recommend the
[Pimsleur][] technique to me just before I got started in earnest. There's a
lot of marketing bullshit around it, but basically, in every lesson, you learn
some phrases, and repeat some old ones to refresh your memory. These phrases
contain some new words. This way, you start to get some feeling for Chinese
grammar without ever reading a grammar book, and you start to learn new words
(which, in most cases, are actually pretty useful). By the time you've finished
Phase 1, you will be able to have some (basic) intelligible conversation, which
is a great motivator.

One really sucky thing about Pimsleur is it has no reading component, even an
optional one. There are unofficial transcripts in a few places, but the company
producing Pimsleur seems to send DMCA notices to anyone that has them hosted.
My recommendation, if reading matters to you (it should, it's very fulfilling),
is to look up the english descriptions in [MDBG][], find the characters, and
find somewhere to put them down for study.

### Quizlet

[Quizlet][] is also an awesome resource to help you in your learning. I write
down all new phrases that I learn as I hear them, in all configurations, and
then put them in a Quizlet set. I usually practise them with the flashcards on
my commute. It also understands Chinese, and can do text-to-speech on the
characters if you like. I recommend putting the pinyin next to the tones in
parenthesis, Quizlet is smart enough to not put these in the text-to-speech
output, and it also doesn't require them as part of your answers in tests.

### Motivation

I'm also lucky to work in a company that has a lot of Chinese-speaking
employees, which means that I usually get to speak to someone in my broken
Chinese at least once or twice a day. I also feel very grateful to my wife who
continues to motivate, encourage, and correct me greatly along the way. Just
being able to use what you've learned is an invaluable source of motivation.

Find someone who speaks Chinese and is willing to help you occasionally. Even
that occasional push will drive you forwards and make you proud of your
achievements.

## Dictionaries

### MDBG/CC-CEDICT

[MDBG][] is an awesome dictionary using [CC-CEDICT][], an open source Chinese to
English dictionary. Unlike many other dictionaries, its entries are almost
strictly about equivalent words, not descriptions of meaning or etymologies. It
also contains a lot of information about colloquial phrases, which is largely
lacking in other dictionaries that I've tried. MDBG is a great reference
dictionary when you see a Chinese word and want to know what it means quickly,
without having to wade through more information than you need. It's also a
great place to find Chinese equivalents to English words, although you might
want to narrow them down further by cross referencing with [Youdao][] to
determine subtle mearnings.

The [Zhongwen][] Chrome extension also uses CC-CEDICT, and allows you to hover
over Chinese and get a translation as an overlay, which allows for a quite
efficient workflow when browsing Chinese content on the web. Here's how it
looks:

### Youdao

[Youdao][] (有道) is a Chinese dictionary, mostly aimed at Chinese speakers.  The
[Android app][Youdao Android app] is pretty awesome, although the interface is
all in Chinese, which might be intimidating if you can't read many characters
yet. If MDBG doesn't understand your phrase and only gives the meaning of
individual characters, there's still a good chance Youdao will.

### Zdic

[Zdic][] is awesome for getting very detailed descriptions of Chinese
characters. It contains extreme detail on calligraphy, radicals, subcomponents,
variant forms, encoding data, input sequences, and detailed histories and
etymologies that are very difficult to find elsewhere.

Note that Zdic is all in Chinese, and sometimes quite fancy Chinese at that. It
can be difficult to read, but it contains a lot of deep insights that you won't
find elsewhere.

## Sentence examples

One of the most motivational aspects of learning Chinese is being able to speak
it with other people. Unfortunately, while you may have the right idea about
basic Chinese grammar, if you're anything like me, your vocabulary will be
quite limited even after a year of learning.

Examples sentences are very important to give you some feeling about when to
use which word, and how to use it. It has much the same function as Pimsleur
for me, except it doesn't encourage structured learning. I mostly use these
sites to learn idiomatic phrasing and vocabulary for a particular topic that I
want to talk about.

### Ichacha

Despite [Ichacha][] (查查) pitching itself as an "online translation" tool,
it's actually more like a dictionary that also has a great deal of example
sentences.

I don't use the dictionary part much, so I can't vouch for its quality. The bit
I *can* vouch for, though, and the best bit about Ichacha, is its vast
repository of (human translated) example sentences. I have no idea where it
gets them from, but the examples are numerous, and almost always excellent
idiomatic representations of their English counterparts.

### Iciba

[Iciba][] (爱词霸) is another awesome source of example sentences that is pitched as a
joint dictionary, translation tool, and source of example sentences. The
subdomain you actually want is [dj.iciba.com](http://dj.iciba.com), which
contains a detailed database of example sentences.

This is pretty much the same deal as Ichacha, just with a different set of
example sentences and a better interface.

### Tatoeba

[Tatoeba][] is another good resource that's solely focused on example
sentences. It's human curated and is generally of good quality, but example
sentences for Chinese are a bit lacking (examples for European languages are
far more numerous). Good for finding basic sentences, but lacking a bit in
quantity.

### LINE

[The dictionary provided by LINE][] is not bad, and the example sentences are
generally pretty good. I've not used it enough to comment much, though.
