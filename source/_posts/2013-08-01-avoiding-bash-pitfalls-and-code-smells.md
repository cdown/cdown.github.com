title: Avoiding bash pitfalls and code smells
---

A few months ago, I did a talk at [WebCamp KL][wckl] about avoiding bash
pitfalls and code smells. The talk went down very well, so here it is for
posterity.

The talk was also available on the WCKL Ustream channel (link now 404, perhaps
they are not on Ustream any more), but the audio was only present in the left
channel, which I fixed in the YouTube upload.
