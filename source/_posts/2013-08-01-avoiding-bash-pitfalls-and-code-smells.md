title: Avoiding bash pitfalls and code smells
description: A video of the talk I did at WebCamp Kuala Lumpur about Bash pitfalls.
---

A few months ago, I did a talk at [WebCamp KL][wckl] about avoiding bash
pitfalls and code smells. The talk went down very well, so here it is for
posterity (it is also available on the [WCKL Ustream channel][ustream], but the
audio is only present in the left channel, which I fixed in the YouTube
upload).
