title: Comments on the new Stack Exchange Android app
---

[Stack Exchange for Android just got released][seblog]. It's awesome, albeit
suffering from the usual problems that always plagued making answers
(especially code-based answers) on a phone. Here are a few things that I think
could be improved:

- Light green is used both to indicate that you [voted up a comment][upvote],
  and that [a question has an accepted answer][accepted].
  This seems pretty confusing, especially since the main site uses orange to
  indicate voting.
- [There is no help writing Markdown when writing a question][bare] (or, I
  assume, when posting an answer -- I haven't tried that yet). You're left to
  type out Markdown syntax manually, which can be extremely painful on a small
  keyboard, especially one that automatically adjusts spacing.
- Scrolling code blocks left and right to see more content appears not to work
  ([note the blue edge shadow in this image][dragcode]). This makes reading
  code answers extremely difficult for now.

Overall though, this gives me hope. The app is extremely pleasant to look at,
and is generally fairly functional even at this early stage. Nice work!
