## Current status

I stopped playing in European TF2 leagues in mid-2012, and these configs have
barely been updated since then. Your mileage may vary. Do not e-mail me about
them, I do not provide any support at all any more.

These configs should continue working just fine into the near future, but they
may be missing optimisations that could be applied on versions of TF2 newer
than the last release.

There are a lot of thanks to be given to Arie for letting me host these at
[FakkelBrigade][] back in the day; without being able to host there in the
early days, these configs would not have been so widely disseminated.
