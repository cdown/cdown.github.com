I'm the 4th most trusted expert on [Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][ulse], and a
regular on many Unix mailing lists. Correctness and simplicity are my main
goals when developing any system. In my free time I design robust, concise
applications across a wide spectrum of languages; you can find my public code
on [my GitHub][github].
