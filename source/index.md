I'm the 4th most trusted expert globally on [Unix & Linux Stack
Exchange][ulse], and a regular on many Unix mailing lists. Correctness and
simplicity (in that order) are my main goals when developing any system.

In my free time I design robust, concise applications across a wide spectrum of
languages; you can find my public code on [my GitHub][github] (or, if you
prefer, it is also [mirrored locally][internal-git]). I am highly influenced by functionalist
design, especially the work of [Dieter Rams][tencommandments].

I currently work as a sysadmin and programmer at [Binary.com][binary] in
Cyberjaya, Malaysia. I'm also involved with [Initiatives of Change][iofc],
mostly maintaining and implementing systems for use in the [Caux conference
centre][caux] in Caux, Switzerland.
