title: "FPS gaming tips from a former pro"
---

It's been a long time since I played TF2 full time with
[FakkelBrigade](http://archive.is/1dLp0) (site sadly dead), almost 6 years now.
There are a bunch of tips and tricks I want to put somewhere from my time
playing TF2 professionally before I forget them entirely, with the hope that
they can help others.

These are almost strictly going to be technical things that you can do to help
remove the computer as a bottleneck for your maximum performance. These tips
will not turn you into a pro gamer, obviously.

- choosing a monitor
    - >120hz monitor
    - pixel response
- choosing the right mouse
    - mx518 was my first, then razer deathadder old version, now g400
    - angle snap
    - accel (neg and pos)
    - prediction
    - suggestions
    - mouse wheel
    - buttons on the side
- mouse pads
    - hard/soft/texture
    - size
- mouse settings
    - mouse accel fix in windows
    - Mouse HZ polling
- game settings
    - raw mouse input if possible
    - lerp/interp
    - high priority in windows
    - no vsync
    - frame rate limiter -- latency of next frame
    - fps config
    - FOV
    - shadows on
    - ragdolls off if possible
- choosing the right keyboard
    - hand positioning
    - suggestions
