title: "FPS gaming tips from a former pro"
---

It's been a long time since I played TF2 full time with
[FakkelBrigade](http://archive.is/1dLp0) (site sadly dead), almost 6 years now.
There are a bunch of tips and tricks I want to put somewhere from my time
playing TF2 professionally before I forget them entirely, with the hope that
they can help others.

These are almost strictly going to be technical things that you can do to help
remove the computer as a bottleneck for your maximum performance. These tips
will not turn you into a pro gamer, obviously.

- choosing a monitor
    - >120hz monitor
    - pixel response
- choosing the right mouse
    - mx518 was my first, then razer deathadder old version, now g400
    - angle snap
        - open paint, draw some straight lines and see if they come out
          straight
    - accel (neg and pos)
    - prediction
    - suggestions
    - mouse wheel
    - buttons on the side

        - mouse rate checker
